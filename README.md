# OpenScout

[OpenScout](https://www.os.onepager.vc/) is a startup company that strives to connect founders with investors through an all-in-one landing platform called the OnePager. As data consultants, my team's primary goal was to advise them on how to increase customer retention on the platform by analyzing the company's social data such as visitation rate, clicks, etc...  After data cleaning and EDA we generated customer survival graphs, user segmentation timelines as well as general user engagement analysis on the platform to provide OpenScout with data-driven business insights.
